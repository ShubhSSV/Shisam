                <br>
                <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> The Shisam plant, also known as Dalbergia sissoo or North Indian Rosewood, offers numerous benefits due to its medicinal and environmental properties. It has long been valued in Ayurvedic medicine, as the bark and leaves have anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and analgesic properties. Traditionally, extracts from the bark and leaves are used to treat skin infections, ulcers, and fevers. Beyond medicinal uses, Shisam is a highly valued timber tree known for its hard and durable wood, which is resistant to termites and decay. Its wood is used in furniture, flooring, and construction due to its rich color and grain, making it both functional and aesthetically pleasing.</p>

                <p><strong>Season:</strong> Shisam trees thrive in a warm climate and are highly adaptable to a range of seasonal conditions. They are deciduous, shedding leaves in the dry season, which helps them conserve water and survive periods of drought. The flowering season for Shisam generally occurs between February and April, producing small, fragrant, white to light yellow flowers. The fruits, which are thin, flat pods, typically mature between May and June. The tree’s seasonal adaptability and hardiness make it suitable for reforestation projects in areas with semi-arid climates.</p>

                <p><strong>Region:</strong> Native to the Indian subcontinent, Shisam is predominantly found in India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Bhutan, especially along riverbanks and in tropical and subtropical regions. It grows abundantly in the foothills of the Himalayas, where it benefits from the region’s natural drainage. In India, Shisam is primarily found in states like Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh. This tree has also been successfully introduced to other regions worldwide, such as Africa and Southeast Asia, due to its resilience and adaptability to different soil types and climates.</p>

                <br>
                <p><strong>Age:</strong> Shisam trees have a long lifespan, often reaching ages of 50 to 100 years under favorable conditions. They grow rapidly in their initial years, reaching about 10 meters in height within the first decade, but their growth rate gradually slows as they age. In managed plantations, they are often harvested between 20 to 30 years for timber, but older trees are valued for their denser, more durable wood. The tree’s longevity and sturdy wood make it ideal for sustainable forestry, providing both environmental and economic value over generations.</p>
